      <description>2019.11.20 I went out to a Chinese restaurant with a friend and their back-of-house online order processing setup was in the middle of the hallway, right across from the bathroom. Small New York restaurants, amiright?
They had the whole wall covered in different iPads and android tablets. Every company they worked with had a seperate tablet that they needed to manage. My friend &amp;ndash; who had worked at Seamless for a small stretch &amp;ndash; explained that each company tends to send out a free, dedicated (read: locked down) tablet to the restaurants for order processing.</description>

      <description>2019.11.28 Wifi Problem? Or did the Smart TV go into screensaver mode and accidently unlock a bunch of back-end options? Either way, looks like Gym Decision connected their window-display smart TV to the public Spectrum Wifi and never looked back. The alert has been there for four days now and it&amp;rsquo;s right next to the front door.
