      <description>Not quite broken. A cola machine sits around, waiting to be maintained. Someone must have opened it, started to work, and then - inevitable distracted - forgot about it without finishing the work. It was there when the movie started, it was there when the movie ended. The staff walk by, either not caring or not knowing what to do. [Continue Reading]</description>

      <description>I went out to a Chinese restaurant with a friend and their back-of-house online order processing setup was in the middle of the hallway, right across from the bathroom. Small New York restaurants, amiright? They had the whole wall covered in different iPads and android tablets. Every company they worked with had a seperate tablet that they needed to manage.

      <description>Wifi Problem? Or did the Smart TV go into screensaver mode and accidently unlock a bunch of back-end options? Either way, looks like Gym Decision connected their window-display smart TV to the public Spectrum Wifi and never looked back.
