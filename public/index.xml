      <description>Deb Chachra: &amp;lsquo;Alone in my apartment, at dusk, I flip a switch to turn on a light. In that instant, not only are my individual senses augmented (now I can see at night), but I become part of a continent-spanning colossus. My reach extends out for thousands of miles, across a national border, encompassing a nuclear power plant, a massive hydroelectric project, scores of substations, thousands of pylons, and an incalculable amount of human expertise, skill, and labour.&amp;rsquo; [Continue Reading]</description>

      <description>Good promotions are all about price, product, and&amp;hellip; positioning. But looks like they approached this one from&amp;hellip; the wrong angle. Ok, I&amp;rsquo;m done with the puns. [Continue Reading]</description>

      <description>Well now. Is it fair to call the COVID-19-initiated crisis the biggest error state of our world economy and healthcare system? Too soon? Ok. I&amp;rsquo;ll write about other things, such as the internet. With many more people suddenly working from home, or simply being home without an opportunity to leave, the internet-as-infrastructure grew severely strained at the end of March. In a couple of memorable instances, it broke. [Continue Reading]</description>

      <description>Not quite broken. A cola machine sits around, waiting to be maintained. Someone must have opened it, started to work, and then - inevitable distracted - forgot about it without finishing the work. It was there when the movie started, it was there when the movie ended. The staff walk by, either not caring or not knowing what to do. [Continue Reading]</description>

      <guid>https://errorstates.com/posts/005-linknyc-distributed-digital-hardware-at-scale/</guid>
      <description>There are a lot of interesting questions that come up when you have to start thinking about how to manage and troubleshoot distributed &lt;em&gt;physical&lt;/em&gt; digital systems at scale. For example: How do you deal with hardware failures, software failures, the weather, and malicious human interaction? [Continue Reading]</description>

      <description>I went out to a Chinese restaurant with a friend and their back-of-house online order processing setup was in the middle of the hallway, right across from the bathroom. Small New York restaurants, amiright? They had the whole wall covered in different iPads and android tablets. Every company they worked with had a seperate tablet that they needed to manage. My friend &amp;ndash; who had worked at Seamless for a small stretch &amp;ndash; explained that each company tends to send out a free, dedicated (read: locked down) tablet to the restaurants for order processing.

      <description>Wifi Problem? Or did the Smart TV go into screensaver mode and accidently unlock a bunch of back-end options? Either way, looks like Gym Decision connected their window-display smart TV to the public Spectrum Wifi and never looked back. The alert has been there for four days now and it&amp;rsquo;s right next to the front door.</description>
