      <title>022 - Bank Error</title>

      <description>My wife and I debated for some time as to whether this qualified as an error state. &amp;lsquo;But it&amp;rsquo;s not entirely broken!&amp;rdquo; she argued. &amp;lsquo;But it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;!&amp;rdquo; I countered right back. Not every error state needs to be an example of something visibly broken. There are good error states. That&amp;rsquo;s one of the joys of looking out for them: what does the correct way to engage with someone look like, when the thing itself is out of order? Do you tape a piece of paper? Do you design for the error? 404 and 503 screens on websites are good examples of such recurring problems that most website themes have an explicit design for them. [Continue Reading]</description>

      <title>021 - Starbucks Screens</title>

      <description>My last year in high school and a few years through college, I worked at Starbucks. It was a pretty great job as far as customer service went. My town happened to have one of the first Starbucks&amp;rsquo; with a hot-food oven &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; a drive-through.  [Continue Reading]</description>

      <description>Of course, screens break for all sorts of reasons. But like a carpenter with a broken down house or a financial planner constantly on the verge of bankruptcy, it isn&amp;rsquo;t a good sales angle. I&amp;rsquo;m picking on Geek Squad because they&amp;rsquo;re the experts in setting these things up right, housed in one of the only stores that has everything you&amp;rsquo;d need to fix this!

      <description>Sometimes, trying to make a machine &amp;lsquo;smart&amp;rsquo; makes it dumb. There&amp;rsquo;s a perfectly fine analog exercise bike next to it. It won&amp;rsquo;t entertain you while you&amp;rsquo;re working out, but maybe you don&amp;rsquo;t need to be exercised while you work out. (Pelaton would argue with me here). But as Blaise Pascal wrote: &amp;lsquo;All of humanity&amp;rsquo;s problems stem from man&amp;rsquo;s inability to sit quietly in a room alone.&amp;rdquo; I wonder what Blaise Pascal would say about entertainment/exercise bikes.

For posterity, I&amp;rsquo;ve rounded up some of the more interesting things to come out related to the intersection of error handling and politics&amp;hellip; as well as updates on the healthcare-x-machine-learning side of things and bitcoin woes.

      <description>Spotted in St. Louis, Missouri. The entire building - a fancy hotel? - was decked out in display panels. An architectural gimmick I&amp;rsquo;ve been noticing more and more, especially to ensure a building stands out at night. But these screens go bad just like every other technology.

      <description>A few new additions to the Weathered Tech x LinkNYC canon. They remind me of the famous opening lines of Anna Karenina: &amp;lsquo;Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.&amp;rsquo; Perhaps the new tag line for ErrorStates should be, &amp;lsquo;Working technologies are all alike; but every technology is broken in its own way.&amp;rsquo; [Continue Reading]</description>

      <description>Deb Chachra: &amp;lsquo;Alone in my apartment, at dusk, I flip a switch to turn on a light. In that instant, not only are my individual senses augmented (now I can see at night), but I become part of a continent-spanning colossus. My reach extends out for thousands of miles, across a national border, encompassing a nuclear power plant, a massive hydroelectric project, scores of substations, thousands of pylons, and an incalculable amount of human expertise, skill, and labour.&amp;rsquo; [Continue Reading]</description>

      <description>Well now. Is it fair to call the COVID-19-initiated crisis the biggest error state of our world economy and healthcare system? Too soon? Ok. I&amp;rsquo;ll write about other things, such as the internet. With many more people suddenly working from home, or simply being home without an opportunity to leave, the internet-as-infrastructure grew severely strained at the end of March. In a couple of memorable instances, it broke. [Continue Reading]</description>

      <description>Not quite broken. A cola machine sits around, waiting to be maintained. Someone must have opened it, started to work, and then - inevitable distracted - forgot about it without finishing the work. It was there when the movie started, it was there when the movie ended.

      <description>I went out to a Chinese restaurant with a friend and their back-of-house online order processing setup was in the middle of the hallway, right across from the bathroom. Small New York restaurants, amiright? They had the whole wall covered in different iPads and android tablets. Every company they worked with had a seperate tablet that they needed to manage. My friend &amp;ndash; who had worked at Seamless for a small stretch &amp;ndash; explained that each company tends to send out a free, dedicated (read: locked down) tablet to the restaurants for order processing.

      <description>Wifi Problem? Or did the Smart TV go into screensaver mode and accidently unlock a bunch of back-end options? Either way, looks like Gym Decision connected their window-display smart TV to the public Spectrum Wifi and never looked back. The alert has been there for four days now and it&amp;rsquo;s right next to the front door.</description>
