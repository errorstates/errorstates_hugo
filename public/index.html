    <p><p>I spent a surprisingly large amount of 2021 flying around from place to place, despite Covid being still a very real and present thing. Being in airports was a strange experience &ndash; despite every sign and precaution telling you to avoid crowding and to keep six feet of distance, you were constantly packed like sardines into air trains and walkways and in waiting areas on the flights themselves.</p>

<p>Masks were often surprisingly hard to find, despite every sign telling you to mask up. Yes, of course you already needed to have your own mask coming into the airport, but after breathing into some masks for a hours at a time, nothing felt better than switching it out for something fresher. And every time someone coughed! Like an infectious yawn, a single loud cough had the ability to draw your attention to everyone around you and be extra mindful of everyone&rsquo;s breathing. It was a lot of stress - if I didn&rsquo;t have a good reason to fly (beyond the environmental reasons, of course), I wouldn&rsquo;t have.</p>

<p>But being in an airport was also very interesting from an &ldquo;Error States&rdquo; perspective. Everyone&rsquo;s staffing was down, and it wasn&rsquo;t usual to see flight staff running from one gate to another, or delays because someone got sick or wasn&rsquo;t available, or things were backed up in general.</p>

<p><img src="/images/026/026-flight-error-2.jpg" alt="&quot;Closeup of a update needed&quot;" /></p>

<p><img src="/images/026/026-flight-error-3.jpg" alt="&quot;Closeup&quot;" /></p>

<p>But in many regards, airports and flights are perfect places for technology and screens to be introduced and to make a positive impact. Airports are data <em>fiends</em>. Flights are constantly being routed and rerouted, or moved around. Like with any logistics-centric businesses, data &ndash; and more importantly, the <em>showcase</em> of data &ndash; is an integral part of the experience.</p>

<p>So when a screen that you&rsquo;re relying on to show you critical information fails, you take notice. And when it happens over and over&hellip; well, it&rsquo;s interesting to see the myriad of ways that this tech breaks.</p>

<p><img src="/images/026/bad-flight-tech-2.jpg" alt="&quot;When your screen fails&quot;" /></p>

<p><img src="/images/026/bad-flight-tech-3.jpg" alt="&quot;Closeup&quot;" /></p>

<p>For example, the iPhoto interruption of the Frontier Airlines gate screen would be funny, if not for the completely vintage OS it is running. Other times it&rsquo;s a little more concerning, such as when you&rsquo;re trying to figure out which gate you&rsquo;re at only to learn that the <code>FidsClient has quit unexpectedly</code>. Should I be concerned?</p>

<p><img src="/images/026/026-aa-2.jpg" alt="&quot;Buying seats&quot;" /></p>

<p>Other times still, it&rsquo;s just frustrating. I was trying to buy a seat (because apparently many flights no longer come with designated seats, while others like Frontier and RyanAir are two steps away from asking you to bring your own, otherwise it&rsquo;s standing room only), but only half of the process seemed to work. I can imagine the engineers now: &ldquo;Well, we delivered on the sprint goal of getting billing to work, but having it actually process your change is something we&rsquo;ll tackle next week&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Or from a security perspective, just seeing routers left out for anyone to plug into, or that the security system keeps rebooting.</p>

<p><img src="/images/026/026-router-2.jpg" alt="&quot;Routers 1&quot;" /></p>

<p><img src="/images/026/026-router.jpg" alt="&quot;Routers Closeup&quot;" /></p>

<p><img src="/images/026/026-general-error.jpg" alt="&quot;Security Reboot&quot;" /></p>

<p>None of it was doom-and-gloom level errors, it was still interesting to see all of the different systems at play: Microsoft and Apple were well represented, but so were many custom systems. Some of the error states were so easy to resolve, assuming someone could walk by and restart it, or remote in and click an option. But unless IT staff were walking around and actively seeing this&hellip; whose problem is it? Is there a staff portal for you to submit a ticket?</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s another frustrating example. I&rsquo;m trying to order food at the ubiquitous iPads that have replaced front-of-house servers. Aside from taking up space where my plate would be, it&rsquo;s also just not working. Which is extremely frustrating, because it&rsquo;s a simple URL error. Don&rsquo;t try to <code>http</code> and <code>https</code> at the same time into your AWS buckets! It&rsquo;s one or the other! Worst of all, it&rsquo;s a touchscreen interface but it&rsquo;s been locked down so that I can see the error, but I can&rsquo;t interact with the browser.</p>

<p><img src="/images/026/026-order-food.jpg" alt="&quot;Ordering food.&quot;" /></p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s some more random screens:</p>

<p><img src="/images/026/026-scala-1.jpg" alt="&quot;Scala Screens&quot;" /></p>

<p><img src="/images/026/026-scala-2.jpg" alt="&quot;Scala Closeup&quot;" /></p>

<p>Or a view of random metadata. This flickered onto the screen for a few seconds, then would cycle to the next screen, and the next. Not the worst thing, but distracting&hellip; and interesting. I have no idea what&rsquo;s going on here.</p>

<p><img src="/images/026/026-metadata.jpg" alt="&quot;Scala Closeup&quot;" /></p>

<p>Last one, I promise. This was from the flight itself, where IT support can&rsquo;t hear you screen. The unfortunate person in front of my spent at least ten minutes trying to get it to work before giving up. It was a long flight.</p>

    <p><p>This isn&rsquo;t an error state per se. But, it does highlight a form of <em>extremely</em> poor design that might as well be an error.</p>

<p>It all started when I wanted to read an article online. I happened to be actively browsing a website with quite a few outbound links, and I opened <em>this</em> link in a new tab, in the background.</p>

<p>Having finished the original article, I switched to read this opened-in-the-background article&hellip; and was very confused. Had I opened something wrong? What was it that I was reading?</p>

<p>The url was fine, trusted, and reputable: <code>MIT Technology Review</code>. But I wasn&rsquo;t sure what I was looking at. I couldn&rsquo;t scroll, I couldn&rsquo;t figure out what I was supposed to be reading.</p>

<p>One by one, I started closing the bloatware:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>First the <code>cookie statement</code>, because I was hoping I&rsquo;d at least see the article title behind it. No dice, I can&rsquo;t see it behind the two advertisements.</p></li>

<li><p>Then the <code>limited time offer</code> modal, because it was an overlay that I couldn&rsquo;t bypass.</p></li>

<li><p>Ah! I see the title of the article, and three lines of the lead-in. But there&rsquo;s another modal taking up 40% of the screen telling me that <code>I'm running out of free articles</code>. It&rsquo;s OK, MIT Tech Review. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll be coming back nor do I read you regularly enough to care. This is a poor pattern: any random link I follow now tells me that I&rsquo;m running out of articles and that I need to sign up to read more. Sorry Texas Monthly, who I clicked through to out of boredom, following a link. Sorry San Diego Gazette, National Chronicle of Higher Education, and a bunch of random sites. I&rsquo;m not your target audience.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Four clicks into the article and I can read it. However,</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The last <code>&quot;Only Two Free Stories Remaining&quot;</code> modal is simply minimized, not removed. If only I had know! I might not have clicked through&hellip;</p></li>

<li><p>There is still a pretty <code>big advert</code> at the top of the screen that follows me as I scroll down.</p></li>

<li><p>As I keep reading, there are <code>mid-article ads</code> that take up the full screen and make it hard for me to scroll past without interacting with them. I resort to the &ldquo;slingshot scroll&rdquo;, slinging my page up so that it scrolls past the adverts on its own. I wonder how much of a publisher&rsquo;s &ldquo;engagement&rdquo; KPIs comes from inadvertent interactions?</p></li>

<li><p>I&rsquo;m still looking at two giant &ldquo;<code>Subscribe</code>&rdquo; buttons in day-glo teal.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The MIT Technology Review is nominally a good magazine, but their digital edition&rsquo;s UX is awful. Who would want to have to go through four clicks in order to read an article still punctuated by adverts? It is adversarial in its antagonism of the reader, taunting both the reader and the writer that the content is just an excuse to reach a targeted, specifically-defined-interest audience. (I&rsquo;ve worked in the editorial space long enough to know this is more likely true than not).</p>

<p>And they&rsquo;re not the only ones. Medium used to be an awful offender as well: similar cookie message, then prompts for me to register or log in, followed by new prompts to download the app, then the banner to sign up for emails&hellip; all closed out only to find that the article is behind a metered paywall, and I&rsquo;m lucky if I&rsquo;m less than 5 articles in&hellip; even for &ldquo;publications&rdquo; that weren&rsquo;t ostensibly on medium.com URLs. And I can go on about the <em>technical</em> faults of these techniques: the bloated weight and decreased speed of pages, the hit on SEO, the number of people turned away by these techniques&hellip;</p>

<p>Grrrr! It all drives me so mad!</p>

<p><em>But Roman, why not just get an ad blocker?</em></p>

<p><em>Or why not use a reader like Pocket, Instapaper, or Read-friendly views?</em></p>

<p>They&rsquo;re good ideas. I should use more ad blockers (and I do on my desktop). I do use readers, but I try to keep those as curated collections of articles to read later, rather than as my primary interface with web content.</p>

<p>More than anything, it&rsquo;s about the principle of the thing &ndash; if you can&rsquo;t read an article or browse the internet without resorting to many different workarounds and tools, all in an ever-evolving battle against invasive adtech and intrusive engagement patterns&hellip; well then something&rsquo;s broken.</p>

<p>More than anything, this bad UX is as bad as any error.</p>

    <p><p>On June 17th, HBO accidentally sent out an email meant for only internal developer audiences. This email was an integration test, confirming that the code was running as intended.</p>

<p>Except, they sent it out to <em>everyone</em>.</p>

<p>&hellip; and the culprit was an intern. Oof.</p>

<p>The internet went wild:</p>

<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We mistakenly sent out an empty test email to a portion of our HBO Max mailing list this evening.

<p>Perhaps because I&rsquo;ve used a number of different accounts as HBO&rsquo;s digital offerings have evolved, I got more than one email.</p>

<hr />

<p>As far as corporate error states go, this one was rather innocent. No private information disclosed, nothing too amiss. So what is an <code>integration test</code>?</p>

<p>Most software goes through a few different types of testing:</p>

<ul>
<li>Unit Testing</li>
<li>Integration Testing</li>
<li>End-to-End Testing</li>
<li>User Acceptance Testing</li>
</ul>

<p><code>Unit Tests</code> are tests written to validate that a function runs correctly. Given <code>x</code> input, we expect <code>y</code> output. A lot of unit tests are done by the developers themselves, and best practices mandate that these functional &ldquo;unit&rdquo; tests are automated.</p>

<p><code>Integration Tests</code> evaluate how different functions/units come together to perform larger functions. Sometimes this is evaluating literal integrations between pieces (is your function talking to the other vendor?), and other times it tests a feature that is made up of multiple functions.</p>

<p><code>End-to-End Tests</code> (or Systems Testing) evaluates the complete system, end-to-end. During this testing, the goal is to make sure that <em>everything</em> still works, even areas your code may not have touched. Because of emergent complexity in software development, bugs, defects, and unforeseen behaviors have a way of showing up far downstream from where changes are made.</p>

<p>For example: a unit test might show a function that works as intended, and the integration test might mean that all of the new units come together as expected. However, if the output of the integration testing has changed, a feature somewhere else might not be able to accept it and <em>that</em> will be the breaking change. End to end tests are long and rigorous for complex software, but aim to catch these emergent issues for both &ldquo;happy&rdquo; paths (if everything is supposed to go as it should) and &ldquo;edge&rdquo; cases (strange input behaviors that are allowable but uncommon).</p>

<p><code>User Acceptance Testing</code> is the last type of testing. It asks: does the thing that was built actually meet the requirements and acceptance criteria that was defined for it? It might work, but not be accepted by a user. Or &ndash; the user might accept it with known defects because those defects might be out of scope of the original request.</p>

<hr />

<p>So there we have it. Some intern somewhere in the engineering department likely triggered an integration test while having their environment variables connected to the &ldquo;real&rdquo; email system, instead of the testing system. And the rest as they say is history.</p>

<p>You drive down your local highway. Strip malls are to your left and right. You stop at a red light. To your left is a sign post, slightly weathered yet traditional &ndash; it lists your Chipotle, your Firehouse Subs, your local T Mobile and AT&amp;T stores, a local hardware store, and a few others. To your right &ndash; well you can&rsquo;t really tell what&rsquo;s going on. Normally, you&rsquo;ll see a rotating screen of promotions &ndash; not every store is listed. But today, it&rsquo;s fuzzy, flickering, and not working. It will stay like this for weeks, promoting the fact that not a single shop has control over the sign and the landlord (or technology provider) won&rsquo;t be around to fix it for days.</p>

    <p><p>My wife and I debated for some time as to whether this qualified as an error state. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s not entirely broken!&rdquo; she argued. &ldquo;But it <em>is</em>!&rdquo; I countered right back.</p>

<p>Not every error state needs to be an example of something visibly broken. There are good error states. That&rsquo;s one of the joys of looking out for them: what does the correct way to engage with someone look like, when the thing itself is out of order? Do you tape a piece of paper? Do you design for the error? 404 and 503 screens on websites are good examples of such recurring problems that most website themes have an explicit design for them.</p>

<p><img src="/images/022/022-chase-2.jpg" alt="&quot;Image Alt Text&quot;" /></p>

<p>Anyway &ndash; I particularly enjoyed seeing something that on the outside looked so dirty and crusty (which I normally would have skipped, but had no choice but to try to use) have a refreshingly working error state. It even had a more analog red &ldquo;X&rdquo; on the side (which I entirely missed) to discourage people from driving up.</p>

<p>But still. I needed my money and had to drive another 20 miles to find another Chase bank. So it goes!</p>

    <p><p>My last year in high school and a few years through college, I worked at Starbucks. It was a pretty great job as far as customer service went. My town happened to have one of the first Starbucks&rsquo; with a hot-food oven <em>and</em> a drive-through.</p>

<p>My coworkers would put me on the drive-through window regularly. The radio made my voice much deeper than it actually was and I had a habit of drawing out and breathing deep into my words: &ldquo;Heyyyyy there.&rdquo; For a lot of folks coming through the drive-through, the voice and the person they met at the window didn&rsquo;t match at all. Some coworkers joked that I sounded like a sex-line operator. &ldquo;Hiiiiiiii&hellip;. What can I get for youuu?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I thought it was pretty funny and leaned into it. Even today &ndash; <em>especially</em> today, with all of our Zoom calls &ndash; I still get coworkers who say that I make a disembodied voice on a computer line sound oddly reassuring and warm.</p>

<p>Anyway, this story has nothing to do with the error state. Even though I try to frequent mom-and-pop shops and local cafes whenever possible, I don&rsquo;t mind stopping by a Starbucks out of some personal nostalgia to observe how they have changed. And once you leave a city&rsquo;s limits, almost every one of them has a drive-through.</p>

<p>But those screens! I&rsquo;m not sure who manufactures them but across the entire country I find drive-through screens with odd but consistent weathering patterns like a fungal infection that targets only a specific type of LCD. I&rsquo;ve seen it in Arizona, Colorado, North Carolina, California, the Dakotas, and New Jersey. I wonder if the vendor from whom they buy these screens is aware of the problem? Many other company&rsquo;s drive-throughs I&rsquo;ve seen are just a radio and a billboard. The billboard still weathers, but it&rsquo;s easier to replace the posterboard inside.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of reasons why a business might put up a screen (or a TV that mirrors a computer). It is eye catching! It can programmatically rotate and display information! It might cost more up front, but switching content out becomes fast and easy and inexpensive after that sunk cost!</p>

<p>But when a screen is misconfigured, it just looks bad.</p>

<p>This is especially true when it hangs under a giant &ldquo;Geek Squad&rdquo; sign, Best Buy&rsquo;s concierge &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll technology your technology for you&rdquo; team. Like a carpenter with a broken down house or a financial planner constantly on the verge of bankruptcy, it isn&rsquo;t a good sales angle.</p>

<p>Of course, screens break for all sorts of reasons. I&rsquo;m picking on Geek Squad because they&rsquo;re the experts in setting these things up right, housed in one of the only stores that has everything you&rsquo;d need to fix this!</p>

    <p><p>Judging by the buttons, it looks like it is running a flavor of <code>Android</code>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/019/019-les-mills-2.jpg" alt="&quot;Les Mills Has Stopped, 2&quot;" /></p>

<p>Another bike:</p>

<p><img src="/images/019/019-les-mills-3.jpg" alt="&quot;Les Mills Has Stopped, 3&quot;" /></p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t blame Les Mills. Cardio is hard.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve never actually pressed the <code>ok</code> button. Do you want to close it? I see it at my local gym pretty routinely. I wonder what will happen? Will it shut the machine down?</p>

<p>Another thought: sometimes, trying to make a machine &ldquo;smart&rdquo; makes it dumb. There&rsquo;s a perfectly fine analog exercise bike next to it. It won&rsquo;t entertain you while you&rsquo;re working out, but maybe you don&rsquo;t need to be exercised while you work out. (Pelaton would argue with me here). But as Blaise Pascal wrote: “All of humanity&rsquo;s problems stem from man&rsquo;s inability to sit quietly in a room alone.”</p>

<p>I wonder what Blaise Pascal would say about entertainment/exercise bikes.</p>

    <p><p>Every so often, I come across an old pay phone. They&rsquo;re usually as raggedy as an old alley cat, broken, and left in the strangest places: parking lots, alley ways, an occasional main street.</p>

<p>From <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/curtissilver/2020/03/03/toss-a-coin-to-your-payphone/?sh=1364ea27537c">Forbes</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This was a business that routinely operated in the tens of millions of dollars. Between massive independent contracts with companies like AT&amp;T and the prison system, it was extremely profitable. I left that company in 2002, onto greener pastures, but it still exits in some form, mostly focused on the prison industry.</p>

<p>Flash forward 20 years and payphones are still around, but not in the way you might think. While they have mostly disappeared from city street corners, (I found one in the Akron airport back in 2014), for-profit payphones are still very present in the prison industry and rural areas where cell phone service is nearly non-existent. Besides these outliers, payphones are might truly be nearing their inevitable end.</p>

<p>The collect calling system is how companies like the one I worked for made most of their money, skirting it was not preferable for those in the industry, I recall my boss always having a fit at seeing the disconnection-after-dialing statistics (which I prepared, as a budding analyst). These numbers directly correlated to the system being abused, but would ultimately be rendered obsolete by text messaging a few years later as well as the fact that many of us just didn&rsquo;t carry pocket change.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never had coins and if I did, broke teenage me didn&rsquo;t want to use them for a call,&rdquo; says automotive journalist who probably wouldn&rsquo;t stop to use a shady rest area payphone now Nicole Wakelin. &ldquo;So if I had to call my Mom to come get me or let her know something, I&rsquo;d make a collect call and when the system asked for my name, it was always &lsquo;Comegetmepracticeisdone&rsquo; or &lsquo;Imnotleavingforanotherhour&rsquo; or whatever I could say in the two seconds I had to record a name.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Free texting before&rsquo;s today texting.</p>

<p>Well, January and February were interested, to say the least. For posterity, I&rsquo;ve rounded up some of the more interesting things to come out related to the intersection of error handling and politics&hellip; as well as updates on the healthcare-x-machine-learning side of things and bitcoin woes.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="when-good-cheap-fast-met-opaque-difficult-and-unresponsive">When &ldquo;Good, Cheap, Fast&rdquo; met &ldquo;Opaque, Difficult, and Unresponsive&rdquo;</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.goodcheapandfast.com/2020">https://www.goodcheapandfast.com/2020</a> or <a href="https://www.johnwdefeo.com/my-work/good-cheap-and-fast">https://www.johnwdefeo.com/my-work/good-cheap-and-fast</a> &ndash; I think they link to the same place.</p>

<p>From time to time, I collect stories about how Google (or insert your favorite FAANG+ group member) will roll someone through a completely opaque process of delisting/deservicing someone with little path to recourse. Twitter and Hacker News tend to be the best places to go because of the number of employees that visit the site. From time to time, an employee will respond, escalate an issue internally, and get it resolved. We&rsquo;re not all so lucky. &ldquo;Good, Cheap, Fast&rdquo;&rsquo;s story is a good example of this &ndash; what goes wrong when your presence and web business is essentially turned off by forces beyond your control.

<p>As Big Data tools reshape health care, biased datasets and unaccountable algorithms threaten to further disempower patients.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I work in healthcare technology and one of the most interesting things our company chose to do &ndash; contrary to common business trends and the direction of the competition &ndash; was to (a) make AI optional, and (b) use AI tools to augment the caregiver&rsquo;s experience, rather than forcing it on the patients. This leaves people in full control over the experience and able to intervene where and when neccessary. But elsewhere, the trends are not so positive:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Data science is remaking countless aspects of society, and medicine is no exception. The range of potential applications is already large and only growing by the day. Machine learning is now being used to determine which patients are at high risk of disease and need greater support (sometimes with racial bias), to discover which molecules may lead to promising new drugs, to search for cancer in X-rays (sometimes with gender bias), and to classify tissue on pathology slides. Last year MIT researchers trained an algorithm that was more accurate at predicting the presence of cancer within five years of a mammogram than techniques typically used in clinics, and a 2018 survey found that 84 percent of radiology clinics in the United States are using or plan to use machine learning software. The sense of excitement has been captured in popular books such as Eric Topol’s Deep Medicine: How Artificial Intelligence Can Make Healthcare Human Again (2019). But despite the promise of these data-based innovations, proponents often overlook the special risks of datafying medicine in the age of artificial intelligence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As always, the main risk drivers are: bad data, inherent biases in the data, a lack of transparency into algorithms, lack of proper clinical input during the development process, centralization of decision-making in a field that requires <em>more, not less</em> individualization and context clues and human-led digging.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Since 1991 I have been contacted by sales people from startups that use AI to make their monitoring system awesome. [&hellip;] Why do these companies fail? None of them made products that actually helped sysadmins (or devops or SREs, etc). They made products that helped what an AI researcher thought would be useful. By definition, an AI researcher does not have operational experience.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and the crux:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Here’s why your AI-based monitoring startup is going to fail:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If I have a small system, it doesn’t need AI to help me.</p></li>

<li><p>If I have a big system, should be made up of components that are clearly defined so that I can route alerts properly.</p></li>

<li><p>If I have one NOC for all of my services and they’re chasing their tail trying to figure out root causes and who is responsible for each service… you have a management problem. First of all, NOCs are bad and you are bad for having one. Second, there’s no single root cause. Third, if you don’t know who is responsible for each service, how the hell would an AI know better than you? Get a damn technical project manager to talk with each team and help them get their monitoring and alerting in order.</p></li>

<p>It is well-known that floating point matrix multiplication can result in a variety of surprises. But did you know that quantized neural networks are not deterministic as well? A quantized neural network uses integers to multiply weights and activations in a neural network. Thus, the naive logic goes, two and three represented and multiplied as integers should always give the exact same result, namely six.</p>

    <p><p>Spotted at an Ikea in Denver, Colorado. Coincidentally, there seems to be only one IKEA in Colorado. Whenever a number of different screens come together, there will be some inevitable drift towards being out-of-sync at some point. This drift can be caused by internal components (a screen burning in or out), external components (wire connections), technology (misconfigurations), or any other reason.</p>

<p><img src="/images/017/ikea-1.jpg" alt="Ikea - broken screens" /></p>

<p><img src="/images/017/ikea-2.jpg" alt="Ikea - broken screens" /></p>

<p>Separately, had a chance to come across this at checkout:</p>

<p><img src="/images/017/ikea-3.jpg" alt="Ikea - broken screens" /></p>

<p>I always find it interesting to look at the OS&rsquo;s that power these devices and what it looks like when they no longer work properly.</p>

<p>Your error screen has to account for three types of end-users: the general audience (people looking at the screen and interacting with it as consumers), the local administrators (likely non-technical local staff), and remote &lsquo;master&rsquo; administrators.</p>

<p>For the general users, you want to lock down the device so that they&rsquo;re not able to manipulate either the hardware or software to do anything except for what you&rsquo;ve allowed them to do. Sometimes this means using off the shelf hardware like an iPad but with special casing to close off all ports and buttons, sometimes there is a custom hardware design. Buying a microcomputer and a screen and fabbing a custom case isn&rsquo;t all that expensive, but there are also enough special-purposes devices being created for checkouts, ordering, and overall in-store experiences that it makes much more sense to buy rather than build.</p>

<p>Then the local administration &ndash; Sometimes this is a physical key to unlock a device or a secret combination of button presses software-side. But when it crashes, how do you enable the local admin repair it? Because, you don&rsquo;t want to give up the keys to the house if the consumer-facing UI errors out, but you also want to be flexible enough to be able to fix things when they go wrong. It&rsquo;s the little details to pay attention to. The few buttons on the top, perhaps? Or a plug point to run remote diagnostics hardware-side.</p>

<p>Then the remote master administration: these folks configure the devices via remote device management (RDM) tools, often hundreds to thousands at a time, and deploy them, do over the air fixes, and so on. Sometimes, you do need to call HQ for troubleshooting. But the worst is when you&rsquo;ve locked down the device so far that you need to completely wipe it because it no longer has an internet connection to be remotely fixed, and isn&rsquo;t open enough to be fixed locally. You&rsquo;re 95% of the way to bricking it at the point.</p>

<p>When I was working with these sorts of projects in at a jewelry company, that was the first. We set up a few devices as a test run, and I ended up going back and forth between HQ and the in-store locations as minute changes cascaded incorrectly, or an IP address would change, or someone would change a local network password and suddenly I lost access to a device. Remote device management is a fun space, but with lots of hidden complexity.</p>

<p>This month the SolarWind hack, FireEye hack, and Timnit Gebru&rsquo;s firing made most of the news.</p>

<h2 id="on-firing-timnit-gebru-google-s-ai-ethics-chief">On Firing Timnit Gebru, Google&rsquo;s AI Ethics Chief</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/12/04/1013294/google-ai-ethics-research-paper-forced-out-timnit-gebru/">We read the paper that forced Timnit Gebru out of Google. Here’s what it says. (MIT Tech Review)</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots: Can Language Models Be Too Big?” lays out the risks of large language models—AIs trained on staggering amounts of text data. These have grown increasingly popular—and increasingly large—in the last three years. They are now extraordinarily good, under the right conditions, at producing what looks like convincing, meaningful new text—and sometimes at estimating meaning from language. But, says the introduction to the paper, “we ask whether enough thought has been put into the potential risks associated with developing them and strategies to mitigate these risks.”</p>

<p>Large language models are also trained on exponentially increasing amounts of text. This means researchers have sought to collect all the data they can from the internet, so there&rsquo;s a risk that racist, sexist, and otherwise abusive language ends up in the training data.</p>

<p>An AI model taught to view racist language as normal is obviously bad. The researchers, though, point out a couple of more subtle problems. One is that shifts in language play an important role in social change; the MeToo and Black Lives Matter movements, for example, have tried to establish a new anti-sexist and anti-racist vocabulary. An AI model trained on vast swaths of the internet won’t be attuned to the nuances of this vocabulary and won’t produce or interpret language in line with these new cultural norms.</p>

<p>It will also fail to capture the language and the norms of countries and peoples that have less access to the internet and thus a smaller linguistic footprint online. The result is that AI-generated language will be homogenized, reflecting the practices of the richest countries and communities.</p>

<p>Moreover, because the training data sets are so large, it’s hard to audit them to check for these embedded biases. “A methodology that relies on datasets too large to document is therefore inherently risky,” the researchers conclude. “While documentation allows for potential accountability, [&hellip;] undocumented training data perpetuates harm without recourse.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/coop-facial-recognition">Co-op is using facial recognition tech to scan and track shoppers (Wired)</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Every time someone enters one of the 18 shops using the tech cameras scan their faces. These CCTV images are converted to numerical data and compared against a watchlist of ‘suspects’ to see if there’s a match. If a match is made, staff within the store receive notifications on smartphones.</p>

<p>“The system alerts our store teams immediately when someone enters their store who has a past record of theft or anti-social behaviour,” Gareth Lewis, Southern Co-op’s loss prevention lead wrote in a blog post on the Facewatch website. The post is the only public acknowledgement of the use of the technology and Lewis says it has been “successful,” with the tech being deployed in branches where there are higher levels of crime.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Stanford Health Care apologized Friday for a plan that left nearly all of its young front-line doctors out of the first round of coronavirus vaccinations. […] The “residents” — medical school graduates who staff the hospital for several years as they learn specialties such as emergency medicine, internal medicine and family medicine — were furious when it became clear that just seven of the more than 1,300 at the medical center were in the first round for vaccinations. Also affected were “fellows,” who work in the hospital as they train further in sub-specialties, nurses and other staff.</p>

<p>Residents across specialties had just been asked to volunteer for extra intensive care unit work in preparation for a surge in covid-19 patients.</p>

<p>An email to pediatrics residents and fellows obtained by The Washington Post said that “the Stanford vaccine algorithm failed to prioritize house staff,” as the early year doctors are known collectively.</p>

<h2 id="error-handling-is-hard">Error Handling is Hard</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to do a deep dive into some different ways of handling errors across programming languages, but this so far is the best example of Error State-specific coverage I&rsquo;ve seen, here re: Rust and Haskell:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Like so many other things, error handling ultimately is a trade-off. When we&rsquo;re writing our initial code, we don&rsquo;t want to think about errors. We code to the happy path. How productive would you be if you had to derail every line of code with thought processes around the myriad ways your code could fail?</p>

<p>But then we&rsquo;re debugging a production issue, and we definitely want to think about errors. We curse our lazy selves for not handling an error case that obviously could have arisen. &ldquo;Why did I decide to abort the process when the TCP connection failed? I should have retried! I should have logged the address I tried to connect to!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then we flood our code with log messages, and are frustrated when we can&rsquo;t see the important bits.</p>

<p>Finding the right balance is an art. And typically it&rsquo;s an art that we don&rsquo;t spend enough time thinking about. There are some well-established tools for this, like runtime-configurable log levels. That&rsquo;s a huge step in the right direction.</p>

<p>Hinges - like everything else on CarpentryHub - are either in a state of permanent development or abandoned. So you design your project for Hinge 13.2, but then you come back a month later - just before you open your Etsy store - and discover that Hinge x.n has now become HingeOS, which is breaking change.</p>

<p>It also has its own HingeAPI, which is poorly documented, somewhere.</p>

<p>You were used to Hinge&rsquo;s ScrewHole 5.3. But that&rsquo;s now buried inside HingeAPI, which calculates your project budget and lifetime carbon footprint for you, but no longer accepts external screwhole positions, because it works its own values from the complex project specification you have to supply - defined in DirkLang, which is a hot new carpentry specification language only ten people know, and replaces HammerLang, which was fifty five years old and very popular but had a lot of frankly questionable design choices.</p>

<p>And the values HingeAPI returns aren&rsquo;t mutable, because mutability is bad practice.</p>

<h2 id="data-bias">Data Bias</h2>

<p>This:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Taxis in my country are generally black. I’ve watched enough movies to know that all of the ones in America are yellow. But in every other country I’ve visited, taxis have been a mish-mash of different hues.</p>

<p>This annoys me. Will Google’s self driving cars simply not recognise London’s Black Cabs? Will any yellow car in the UK be classified as a taxi by the infallible algorithm? Will Google refuse to believe I’m human simply because I don’t know what a Twinkie is?</p>

<p>Before sticking a comment below, riddle me this – if something costs a half-a-crown, and you pay with a florin, how many tanners will you get in your change?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Vaughan was spurred into action when the continuous glucose monitor (CGM) function on a mobile app used by his daughter, who has had Type-1 Diabetes her entire life, failed. &ldquo;Features were disappearing, critical alerts weren&rsquo;t working, and notifications just stopped,&rdquo; he stated. As a result, his nine-year-old daughter, who relied on the CGM alerts, had to rely on their own instincts.
The apps, which Vaughan had downloaded in 2016, were &ldquo;completely useless&rdquo; by the end of 2018. &ldquo;The Vaughans felt alone, but suspected they weren&rsquo;t. They took to the reviews on Google Play and Apple App store and discovered hundreds of patients and caregivers complaining about similar issues.&rdquo;
Code rot isn&rsquo;t the only issue lurking in medical device software. A recent study out of Stanford University finds the training data used for the AI algorithms in medical devices are only based on a small sample of patients. Most algorithms, 71 percent, are trained on datasets from patients in only three geographic areas &ndash; California, Massachusetts and New York &ndash; &ldquo;and that the majority of states have no represented patients whatsoever.&rdquo; While the Stanford research didn&rsquo;t expose bad outcomes from AI trained on the geographies, but raised questions about the validity of the algorithms for patients in other areas.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The bigger concern is the electronics. New owners have complained about minor, but annoying, glitches: a clock that works only intermittently, keyless entry failure, irregularities with the preprogrammed infotainment system, poor operation of the side-hinged rear door, even an engine stall at a stoplight when the stop-start function failed.</p>

<p>Although I didn’t note any issues with the electronics or technology on my desert run, the reports I’ve heard of computer errors must temper my endorsement. When I asked the company about these problems afterward, it responded that corrective software updates are “the new normal” in the auto business. So, caveat emptor: After a top-to-bottom rethink, the alpha male of off-roading is still in beta.</p>
