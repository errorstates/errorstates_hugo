An architectural gimmick I&amp;rsquo;ve been noticing more and more, especially to ensure a building stands out at night. But these screens go bad just like every other technology.

      <description>A few new additions to the Weathered Tech x LinkNYC canon. They remind me of the famous opening lines of Anna Karenina: &amp;lsquo;Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.&amp;rsquo; Perhaps the new tag line for ErrorStates should be, &amp;lsquo;Working technologies are all alike; but every technology is broken in its own way.&amp;rsquo; [Continue Reading]</description>
