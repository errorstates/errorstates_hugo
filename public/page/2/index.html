    <p><p>Following up on the last post, spotted in a <code>Taco Bell</code> in Arizona. Above, a better error state &ndash; an option for how to continue the experience. Below, a worse one, designed not for the end user but for administrators. Likely an internet issue?</p>

    <p><p>Spotted in a &ldquo;Plant Power&rdquo; in Riverside, California.</p>

<p><img src="/images/013/IMG_3706.jpg" alt="Internet explorer" /></p>

<p><img src="/images/013/IMG_3706_2.jpg" alt="Not so future" /></p>

<p>Internet Explorer 11 is not so future in my book.</p>

<p>While I&rsquo;m not a food blogger, I&rsquo;m happy to support Plant Power&rsquo;s overall mission. More plant based food &ndash; not just <code>Impossible</code> or <code>Beyond</code> meat alternatives are good in my book, even if the vegan options end up mimicking the problems of fast food. One battle at a time, right?</p>

<p><img src="/images/013/IMG_3705.jpg" alt="Facial recognition futures" /></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s just that the innovations don&rsquo;t stop there. I&rsquo;ve got a longer <code>Facial Recognition</code> post coming up, so my hot take is &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t support this&rdquo;. I actively opt out of this sort of infrastructure. Having worked on facial-tracking kiosk tech as a special project during my career, I am happy to report at how slippery the slope can be from &ldquo;awesome use case&rdquo; to &ldquo;creepy use case we probably don&rsquo;t want the customers to know about&rdquo;.</p>

<p><img src="/images/013/IMG_3709.jpg" alt="Not so future" /></p>

<p>Luckily, the technology didn&rsquo;t work, downed by the simple internet.</p>

<p>This is a recurring theme: kiosk systems don&rsquo;t seem to have a local mesh network option enabled. Wouldn&rsquo;t that be a better fallback? I can easily imagine a future of food tech tablets that &ndash; if the internet is missing &ndash; all connect to each other plus a central office computer to continue placing and routing orders. Perhaps even processing payments locally, or storing transactions for processing after the fact? Or at least routing orders and creating instructions to pay at the front.</p>

<p>Another option is to rely on the internet of the end user &ndash; once an order is placed, a ticket is printed with a QR code &ndash; the user can scan it to complete payment, which will route the full order to the cooks.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of interesting possibilities, but &ldquo;Internet is Offline&rdquo; is not one of them.</p>

    <p><p>A few new additions to the &ldquo;Weathered Tech x LinkNYC&rdquo; canon. They remind me of the famous opening lines of Anna Karenina: &ldquo;Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.&rdquo; Perhaps the new tagline for ErrorStates should be, &ldquo;Working technologies are all alike; but every technology is broken in its own way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not quite true. Most broken technologies are actually <em>broken</em> in the same way: you cannot interact with them because their fail state renders them 100% inoperable. But any excuse for a good quote, no?</p>

This kiosk was punched out.</p>

A good example of weathered tech not withstanding many seasons.</p>

Not only was this one not working, but the reflection was a creepy flaming cross.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://a-new-program-for-graphic-design.org"><strong>A *New* Program for Graphic Design</strong></a>, David Reinfurt recounts a trip he made to MIT while researching the work of Muriel Cooper, an artist and researcher who&rsquo;s work spanned neatly spanned the analog commercial production of art with early digital production:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We proceed by visiting the MIT Media Lab, where Muriel Cooper spent the last years of her working life, from 1985-1994, continuing the work of the Visible Language Workshop. I&rsquo;m here to meet a graduate student who&rsquo;s procured a LaserDisk which includes some of the last work of the Workshop. With LaserDisk in hand, we spend the next hour or so trawling various sub basements of the Media Lab building searching for an analog LaserDisc player capable of playing the 20-year-old media format. As we enter more than one room containing stacks of outdated hardware, too difficult to repair, and rotting magnetic-tape formats whose chemical clocks are ticking, I am struck by the ways in which this recent past becomes so quickly inaccessible in a digital medium. In stark contrast to the piles of posters that provide a visceral record of the Center for Advanced Visual Studies, these dead media provide nothing tangible. (As much of Muriel Cooper&rsquo;s most important work was in a digital medium, I become more convinced that accounting for her work is critical - now.) <sup>1</sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>20 years for obsolescence to set in, in an archive.</p>

<p>Others are not so lucky. Here&rsquo;s Reinfurt again, now describing the Tetracono by Bruno Munari. It&rsquo;s a small-run piece of &ldquo;time based&rdquo; art that changes as you watch it. Reinfurt set out to find a working copy, and has come across it at an archivist&rsquo;s storage:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We unpacked it, but we couldn&rsquo;t find the power cord. The archivist found it a bit later that evening, plugged it in, started it up, and sent me a video. What I noticed immediately was that the Tetracono was running, yes, but, based on everything I had uncovered, it was running incorrectly according to Munari&rsquo;s program. [&hellip;]</p>

<p>On returning, we confirmed the fact that it was, in fact, counter to the way that Munari had intended. The archivist had been working with the foundation for a long time and was involved when this Tetracono had been &ldquo;renovated&rdquo; about 14 years earlier for a show at the Museo del Novecento. [&hellip;]</p>

<p>She knew the person who worked on it and called him. He&rsquo;s retired since, but his workshop exists and between them they decided, yes, this should definitely be corrected. Three months later, the Tetracono was fixed and is now running correctly. So my design research project then accidentally became a historic preservation project. <sup>2</sup></p>

<p>Why bring this up? Much of our known history is told through artifacts that we have left behind. Object and records are preserved &ndash; sometimes intentionally through safekeeping in Museums and collections, sometimes accidentally by being lost or buried, sometimes entirely unintentionally such as clay cuneiform tablets that were preserved by the act of razing villages and cities.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a drift that comes with time. I remember walking through the British Museum in London and being struck by a collection of beautiful objects that were more than 4000 years old, about which we know very little. Who made it? What was it used for? Many times, we can only speculate.</p>

<p>Culture and ideas are not too different. Here&rsquo;s architect Jimenez Lai on such drift:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Our customs, costumes, habits, habitations, and manners are abstractions that make up civilization. The practical functions of many human activities grow obsolete from their original intentions with every new generation. Nevertheless, they are abstracted and cherished. Rituals are records of what we once considered beautiful.&rdquo; <sup>3</sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="https://blog.britishmuseum.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Worlds-oldest-customer-complaint.png" alt="Mesopotamian tablet was written nearly 4000 years ago" /></p>

<p>In Japan, the aging of objects and exploration of their imperfections is reflected in the culture of production. Wabi-sabi, mono no aware, and other aesthetic concepts not only drive how things are made, they also implicitly hint at the longevity and accumulation of future-heritage of these objects:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The works was to be picked up, used, and thus in some way brought to life. Over time, and with everyday use, their appearance inevitably changes. Discolorations and traces of heat and humidity become visible, and with them the memory of the mutability, imperfection, and impermanence of all existence in the world. [&hellip;] Their works are always functional, yet they sometimes seem like art objects too, which is not a contradiction in terms. A separation between applied and &ldquo;pure&rdquo; art, between art and craft, did not exist in Japan for a long time. <sup>4</sup></p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p>Digital media is in many ways the opposite of future-facing/time-tested craftsmanship. Digital media is haunted by its rot and obsolescence in the way that strictly physical objects are not.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of digital media. One is digital media that has a physical embodiment. The other is the realm of the purely digital.</p>

<p>It goes without saying that physically embodied things degrade. Things are <em>designed</em> to degrade. But digital media&rsquo;s degradation leaves no trace of the original content, just a useless container for what was. Reinfurt&rsquo;s LaserDisks is an example. Vinyl get scratched and becomes unplayable, unreadable. Tapes melt into tree sap.<sup>5</sup> Batteries lose their charges and can&rsquo;t power their cases anymore. Powercords are lost. Magnetic tapes get erased. The original strips of card-powered programming tear, get eaten away by bugs, become dust. The players get lost and cannot read the content.</p>

<p>We are left with sentimental husks of plastic and metal - the treasure box but not the treasure.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there is the realm of the purely digital. Programs, code, <em>ideas</em>. For most of recorded history, ideas were recorded in books and on parchment and in stone, or carried on through oral traditions. Today, the greatest volume of these are stored on servers &ndash; still physically embodied, but for the most part abstracted away for the bulk of us.</p>

<p>With that in mind, it is susceptible to bit rot (data degradation). Consider the following:</p>

<p><img src="/images/011-bit-rot.png" alt="&quot;Bit Rot&quot;" /></p>

<p>An image file has thousands upon thousands of bits. The image above is 378kb - tiny compared to an average photograph, rather large for web purposes. That&rsquo;s 378,000 bits. Just 3 bits changed and the image is not just unrecoverable&hellip; it is garbage.</p>

<p>Wikipedia, helpful as ever, lists 4 types of bit rot:<sup>6</sup></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Solid-state media, such as EPROMs, flash memory and other solid-state drives, store data using electrical charges, which can slowly leak away due to imperfect insulation. The chip itself is not affected by this, so reprogramming it approximately once per decade prevents decay. An undamaged copy of the master data is required for the reprogramming.</p></li>

<li><p>Magnetic media, such as hard disk drives, floppy disks and magnetic tapes, may experience data decay as bits lose their magnetic orientation. Periodic refreshing by rewriting the data can alleviate this problem. In warm/humid conditions these media, especially those poorly protected against ambient air, are prone to the physical decomposition of the storage medium.</p></li>

<li><p>Optical media, such as CD-R, DVD-R and BD-R, may experience data decay from the breakdown of the storage medium. This can be mitigated by storing discs in a dark, cool, low humidity location. &ldquo;Archival quality&rdquo; discs are available with an extended lifetime, but are still not permanent. However, data integrity scanning that measures the rates of various types of errors is able to predict data decay on optical media well ahead of uncorrectable data loss occurring.</p></li>

<li><p>Paper media, such as punched cards and punched tape, may literally rot. Mylar punched tape is another approach that does not rely on electromagnetic stability.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I&rsquo;m tempted to add compression as another, intentional form of bit rot. Once compressed, the original is unrecoverable. Things can only shrink.</p>

<p>Of course, there&rsquo;s more than just plain &lsquo;rot&rsquo; that happens. My parents spent many years working as database architects and administrators. I grew up listening to much shop talk about failed data migrations, lost transactions due to improperly implemented code, lost or deleted backups, optimizations that went wrong, sync processes that went out of sync, and the arduous process of fixing those messes day in and day out.</p>

<p>Most people don&rsquo;t see those issues because they&rsquo;re corrected by the time you log in to an app. But not always. I recently had a scare where my blog&rsquo;s server went down and I realized my backups were on the same server as the original files. If anything happened to the server &ndash; a level I had abstracted away in my mind, but was painfully always present &ndash; I would lose both with no recourse. <sup>7</sup></p>

<p>And if you&rsquo;re not in control of your platforms, you&rsquo;re often not in control at all. One must always be thoughtful of the tools you&rsquo;re using. For example, I ran an out-of-the-box WordPress blog for many years. I would upload photos to show to people &ndash; and assuming that my blog was backed up and that saving things on the internet is better than on a computer that had little space and fragile hard drives, I would delete the original images. It wasn&rsquo;t until much later, when I was trying to rebuild my archives, that I discovered that WordPress had automatically compressed my images &ndash; a trade off of quality for performance. There was no way to recover my original images.</p>

<p>Or consider the following, more terrifying example:</p>

<blockquote>
<h3 id="lightroom-app-update-wipes-users-photos-and-presets-adobe-says-they-are-not-recoverable">Lightroom App Update Wipes Users’ Photos and Presets, Adobe Says they are ‘Not Recoverable’</h3>

<p>This morning, multiple readers wrote in to alert us to a major Adobe gaffe. It seems the latest update to the Lightroom app for iPhone and iPad inadvertently wiped users’ photos and presets that were not already synced to the cloud. Adobe has confirmed that there is no way to get them back. [&hellip;] This was followed by replies from other users saying that the same thing happened to them, whether or not they were subscription based or free. One user posted to Reddit’s r/Lightroom subreddit saying that they had lost “2+ years of edits” after the update.<sup>8</sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This doesn&rsquo;t even begin to recount proprietary file formats that are no longer supported and thus unopenable, or services that have shut down on the internet. Remember Geocities or Tripod blogs? Vibrant yahoo forums? &lsquo;<em>Like tears in the rain</em>,&rsquo; as Roy Batty puts it.</p>

<hr />

<p><img src="/images/011-data-centers.jpg" alt="Microsoft's underwater datacenters" /></p>

<p>Going back to data center for a moment, the industry has come a long way since someone stored a single server somewhere that was the mainframe. Multi-zone availability, different types of syncing, quests to perfect synchronization have yielded very interesting technical developments. Heck, Google had to invent a new concept of time in order to manage its worldwide Spanner database.<sup>9</sup> Meanwhile, Microsoft is storing its data center underwater and filled with dry nitrogen to account for both energy savings and data loss. After two years underwater, &ldquo;our failure rate in the water is one-eighth of what we see on land,” Microsoft reported.<sup>10</sup></p>

<p>Surely better than a book would have fared underwater, but better than the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antikythera_mechanism">Antikythera mechanism</a>, the prototypical computer?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m often reminded of &ldquo;<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/06/can-neuroscience-understand-donkey-kong-let-alone-a-brain/485177/">Can Neuroscience Understand Donkey Kong, Let Alone a Brain?
</a>&rdquo;, research that pointed out that our techniques for understanding brains by looking at the hardware are woefully inadequate analogues for understanding similarly complex digital processes by looking strictly at their circuit boards.<sup>11</sup> If a data center goes down, what do we understand from the circuit boards? Are the programs &ndash; stored as electron charge configurations &ndash; readable through any form of technical, reconstructive archeology?</p>

<p>The oldest recorded audio recordings &ndash; dating back to &lsquo;phonautographs&rsquo; in the 1850s &ndash; were recently reconstructed with some pretty clever physics:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now, what that means is just that someone is standing in front some kind of a funnel and speaking, shouting, singing - we don&rsquo;t know doing what - into that funnel. It vibrates a little membrane, and that wiggles a stylus that scratches this wavy line on a sheet of paper.</p>

<p>[&hellip;] They&rsquo;ve been working on developing optical message for playing back early sound recordings on delicate media such as, you know, wax phonograph cylinders and so on. The idea being that since nothing is touching the groove except light, there&rsquo;s no wear and tear on the original as there would be if you try to use a traditional stylus or a needle. So adapting that technology to play back a wavy line on a piece of paper was really pretty straight forward. In fact, it may have been simpler because we&rsquo;re just dealing with two dimensions. <sup>12</sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Similar methods were used for reading scrolls burnt in Pompeii, and older scrolls from biblical times: too fragile to unroll, x-rays and AI were used to virtually unravel and color-contrast the inks form the paper:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Although you can see on every flake of papyrus that there is writing, to open it up would require that papyrus to be really limber and flexible – and it is not any more,” said Prof Brent Seales, chair of computer science at the University of Kentucky, who is leading the research.</p>

<p>Seales and his team have previously used high-energy x-rays to “virtually unravel” a 1,700 year old Hebrew parchment found in the holy ark of a synagogue in En-Gedi in Israel, revealing it to contain text from the biblical book of Leviticus. <sup>13</sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Very few people want to think that the work we&rsquo;ve made could be lose-able, especially in so short a period of time. Would similar methods &ndash; some sort of spectrometer, perhaps &ndash; be useful one day for reconstructing solid state hard drives after we&rsquo;ve moved so far past them, and not continually replicated the data onto new mediums?</p>

<p>And what of the Voyager messages, sent through space in the 70s with then-cutting edge technology?<sup>14</sup> Hoping to be recovered by&hellip; distant travelers? Aliens? And when found&hellip; how will they be read, understood? If someone uninformed found it on earth, even today &ndash; would they know what to do with it, how to read it, how to listen to it? Or at just past 50 years, is it as barely decipherable as biblical tablets and burnt papyrus scrolls?</p>

<p><sup>4</sup> - &ldquo;Craftland Japan&rdquo;, Pg 8-9. There&rsquo;s a forthcoming book about the &ldquo;encrapification&rdquo; of American production that reads as the diametric opposite of this philosophy. You can find an excerpt here, <a href="https://lithub.com/the-long-golden-age-of-useless-american-crap/">&ldquo;The long, golden age of useless American crap&rdquo;</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The encrappification of America dates back centuries. While there were, undoubtedly, once village blacksmiths who forged brittle nails, farm women who adulterated their butter, and tailors who cut corners, these were the exceptions. Most things were made by skilled and reputable hands working with good intentions, supplying the needs of people within local communities. The consumer revolution, which began in the mid-1700s, changed all that.</p>

<p>This lessened the burdens of ownership itself: now easily discarded and just as easily replaced, possessions no longer had to be painstakingly cared for. The marketplace of crap turned a broken kettle or cracked dish from a crisis into a mere inconvenience effortlessly—and pleasurably—ameliorated by a new purchase.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><sup>5</sup> -  Consider this hilarious [to me] account of &ldquo;baking&rdquo; tapes to temporarily preserve them:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For quite a few years now, I&rsquo;ve worried about, and mentioned here, the panic and depression that sets in once you experience your original Dolby Master tapes turning into PTS (Pure Tree Sap!) It&rsquo;s by now a very well known condition, and some of you have gone through the debacle. I&rsquo;d like to thank those of you wrote me and explained that there are several steps you can take to restore (albeit only temporarily) these tapes to playable condition. Gives one time to make a few very clean copies, so that if the master continues to croak, at least you&rsquo;ll have these protection copies. [&hellip;] Many of you well know all of this. A trick which took a while to discover, was to bake the affected tapes gently in a controlled &ldquo;oven&rdquo; of some kind, for a few hours, enough to drive off the water, and allow many of the molecules to migrate back where they belong. You also must allow the tapes to cool back down slowly, or water gets reabsorbed. And you can&rsquo;t use a gas oven, which generates steam molecules in the warm air (if it also doesn&rdquo;t wreck your tapes from uneven heating!) The back coating was affected in similar ways, on tapes that used this well-intended bad idea. This coating is also made somewhat more stable by the slow heating and cooling process.</p>

<p>Lots of items this month that caught my eye.</p>

<h2 id="dear-google-cloud-your-deprecation-policy-is-killing-you">Dear Google Cloud, Your Deprecation Policy is Killing You</h2>

<p><a href="https://medium.com/@steve.yegge/dear-google-cloud-your-deprecation-policy-is-killing-you-ee7525dc05dc">https://medium.com/@steve.yegge/dear-google-cloud-your-deprecation-policy-is-killing-you-ee7525dc05dc</a></p>

<p>Steve Yegge&rsquo;s Platforms Rant was deeply influential in how I thought about platform design, and this is similarly thought provoking for building and maintaining SaaS infrastructure. I want to call it &ldquo;Sustainable Infrastructure&rdquo;.</p>

<p><em>Related:</em> Rachel by the Bay&rsquo;s post are also always on point, and this one ends with a nice coinage:
<code>VendorOps</code>&rdquo; as a job: <a href="http://rachelbythebay.com/w/2020/08/14/jobs/">http://rachelbythebay.com/w/2020/08/14/jobs/</a></p>

<h2 id="here-s-why-apple-believes-it-s-an-ai-leader-and-why-it-says-critics-have-it-all-wrong">Here’s why Apple believes it’s an AI leader—and why it says critics have it all wrong</h2>

<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/08/apple-explains-how-it-uses-machine-learning-across-ios-and-soon-macos/">https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/08/apple-explains-how-it-uses-machine-learning-across-ios-and-soon-macos/</a></p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t really par for the course of error states, but as I continue doing research into how Machine Learning is deployed in the world, I find Apple&rsquo;s position an interesting one:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Machine learning is used to help the iPad&rsquo;s software distinguish between a user accidentally pressing their palm against the screen while drawing with the Apple Pencil, and an intentional press meant to provide an input. It&rsquo;s used to monitor users&rsquo; usage habits to optimize device battery life and charging, both to improve the time users can spend between charges and to protect the battery&rsquo;s longterm viability. It&rsquo;s used to make app recommendations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s very much about Machine Learning as augmenting experience based on <em>your</em> data, among other things. I think it&rsquo;s a worthwhile exploration of microdata and microdetails that can be used to craft <em>adaptive</em> experiences that you wouldn&rsquo;t even think of personalized.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But what still blows me away is the number of financial and other sensitive accounts I could access if I were of a devious mind. This particular email address has accounts that I never asked for at H&amp;R Block, Turbotax, TaxAct, iTunes, LastPass, Dashlane, MyPCBackup, and Credit Karma, to name just a few. I’ve lost count of the number of active bank, ISP and web hosting accounts I can tap into.</p>

<p>I’m perpetually amazed by how many other Gmail users and people on similarly-sized webmail providers have opted to pick my account as a backup address if they should ever lose access to their inbox. Almost certainly, these users just lazily picked my account name at random when asked for a backup email — apparently without fully realizing the potential ramifications of doing so. At last check, my account is listed as the backup for more than three dozen Yahoo, Microsoft and other Gmail accounts and their associated file-sharing services.</p>

<p>No, this isn&rsquo;t something related to a DnD campaign. Riving wood means splitting it along the direction of its long fibers. It&rsquo;s a 17th century technique this is unused anymore because cheap mechanical manufacturing and demand for low cost goods means we don&rsquo;t need to care as much about the quality of construction. I&rsquo;m filing this one under &ldquo;skills we&rsquo;ve lost with time.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="our-cyborg-collective">Our Cyborg Collective</h2>

<p><a href="https://tinyletter.com/metafoundry/letters/metafoundry-73-our-cyborg-collective-body-ourselves">https://tinyletter.com/metafoundry/letters/metafoundry-73-our-cyborg-collective-body-ourselves</a></p>

<p>The whole thing is excellent, but I want to highlight something particular:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m spending this summer writing a book that is mostly about networked infrastructures. Since I was a little girl, I&rsquo;ve been in love with the charismatic megastructures of these systems—from power stations and transportation hubs, to dams and bridges and water treatment plants and now data centers. But when I started spending a lot of time with infrastructure, it became clearer and clearer that these systems are as much social as they are technological, and that&rsquo;s the tangled Gordian knot. I came to realize how much they are a product of social norms, whether it&rsquo;s putting the kettle on for tea when your TV show ends or a willingness to raze African-American neighborhoods for the convenience of white suburban commuters. And I began to think about these technological systems in the context of their allied systems.</p>

<p>Three years ago, I wrote this in the Atlantic:</p>

<p>Besides these physical networks, there are a host of other systems that exist primarily to contribute to the common good by taking on responsibility for safety, access and planning. I don’t have to know where my breakfast eggs came from to know they’re safe to eat, because of the United States Department of Agriculture. When I fill a prescription, the pills I’m given will be efficacious, thanks to the Food and Drug Administration. The Center for Disease Control tracks and responds to outbreaks before they become epidemics. I’ve been known to get on a plane and fall asleep before takeoff; my security is because the Federal Aviation Authority regulates air traffic. And these are just a handful of ways these systems affect my daily life.</p>

<p>[This is an essay from the Before Times; in the US, of course, we are now living the tragic consequences of what happens when some of these systems that we rely on fail, are ignored, or are deliberately undermined.]</p>

<p>The infrastructure researcher and science fiction writer Paul Graham Raven has offered up a surprising and insightful way of thinking about our infrastructural systems: he describes them as making us a &lsquo;cyborg collective&rsquo;. Not an individual cyborg, in the &lsquo;Ellen Ripley operating a power loader&rsquo; sense, and not a collective of individual cyborgs, but a single cyborg collective:
Infrastructures are a sort of tool: they’re a prosthesis, an extension of baseline human abilities. … But it’s not just you that’s dependent on infrastructure, the way an earlier you was dependent on being able to knap flint and whittle bone. No - you’re dependent on infrastructure as a community. The prostheses upon which your life now depends are augmentations not of your own body, but of the collective body of your tribe or village.</p>

<p>Congratulations: you’ve just transitioned from being a collective of cyborgs to being a cyborg collective.</p>

<p>Alone in my apartment, at dusk, I flip a switch to turn on a light. In that instant, not only are my individual senses augmented (now I can see at night), but I become part of a continent-spanning colossus. My reach extends out for thousands of miles, across a national border, encompassing a nuclear power plant, a massive hydroelectric project, scores of substations, thousands of pylons, and an incalculable amount of human expertise, skill, and labour. As an individual, I only call on the tiniest sliver of everything this system produces, but it couldn’t exist were it not collective. As Paul notes, this system binds me to my neighbors, and to the place where we all live.</p>

<p>But here’s the thing: all cyborgs consist of a technological augmentation and also a biological component. And it&rsquo;s not just the technological part of our cyborg selves that is collective. Our bodies are part of a biological collective too. As with the technological part of our collective cyborg-ness, we’ve worked hard to create a system that works so effectively that we don’t notice it until it fails, or it founders on being faced with novel challenges. We call it ‘public health’.</p>

<p>Marketing is all about personalization. Reach the right person, at the right time/place, with the right message. Personalized marketing tends to have better conversion rates. So of course, we do personalized marketing.</p>

<p>But sometimes it goes wrong. I&rsquo;ve been on the other side of this many times. Making a mistake is easy: a content management system &ndash; say, Mailchimp or Hubspot or something &ndash; gives you the option to add a &lsquo;personalization&rsquo; token. perhaps the user&rsquo;s first name, or their email address. You add it, and it shows up all nice and <code>formatted</code>, a visual placeholder. Sometimes, you even add a fallback display (<code>If first name is missing, then use &quot;there&quot;</code> as in, &ldquo;Hi There&rdquo;).</p>

<p>For example, Hubspot:</p>

<p><img src="/images/010-personalize-templates.png" alt="&quot;Hubspot&quot;" /></p>

<p>Or MailChimp:</p>

<p><img src="/images/010-mailchimp.png" alt="&quot;Mailchimp&quot;" /></p>

<p>But maybe you copy that as code. Or a developer goes in and makes a modification. Or perhaps you forgot you CMS&rsquo; convention and used the wrong code. Or %%First Name%% could be pseudocode from a text document that was overlooked and accidentally used.</p>

<p>Whatever the case is, you send out the email and instead of it looking personalized, it looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="/images/010-first-name-1.JPG" alt="&quot;Dear %%First Name%%, 2&quot;" /></p>

<p><em>Sigh.</em> How are you supposed to know my size, if you don&rsquo;t even know your name?</p>

<p>Anyway, it happens. It&rsquo;s more annoying when a <em>spammer</em> does it (sorry Eric, I have no idea who you are and why you&rsquo;re emailing me), less so if it&rsquo;s a brand that messes up, assuming I expected to hear from them.</p>

<p>Cue my burly army ranger voice: <em>I&rsquo;ve got war stories about this&hellip;</em> Because it&rsquo;s not the end of a brand&rsquo;s troubles.</p>

<p><img src="/images/010-drizzly-fail.jpeg" alt="&quot;Drizzly gets it wrong&quot;" />
(This one isn&rsquo;t mine. Source: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/christophschachner_marketing-activity-6673127048275361792-astj/">https://www.linkedin.com/posts/christophschachner_marketing-activity-6673127048275361792-astj/</a>)</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re working with a self-submitted form, then you can have bad data or formatting if it isn&rsquo;t cleaned properly. It&rsquo;s just as likely that you might find yourself emailing &ldquo;Hi JENNIFER&rdquo; or &ldquo;Hi jennifer&rdquo;, assuming you forgot to add the <code>style=&quot;text-transform:capitalize;&quot;</code> inline code.</p>

<p>Sometimes, you get a wise-ass who submits their name as &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not telling you!!&rdquo;&hellip; which makes for a funny &ldquo;Hi I&rsquo;m Not Telling You!!&rdquo; email somewhere down the road.</p>

<p>Or if you&rsquo;re working with a &ldquo;Full Name&rdquo; form, you need to be mindful of how the data is being split for personalization. That kind of stuff is hard to write rules around &ndash; it ranges from &ldquo;Dr.&rdquo; or &ldquo;Mr.&rdquo; sometimes being the first name, or having &ldquo;III&rdquo; being the last name if split by spaces. Never mind the eternal questions about what to do with people with three names. That middle name &ndash; do you hide it? Keep it as part of a last name? First name? It&rsquo;s just bad form design in my opinion.</p>

<p>Next time someone addresses you as &ldquo;Hi %%First Name%%!&rdquo;, just think of this blog post.</p>

<h2 id="bad-code-will-get-people-killed">&ldquo;Bad Code Will Get People Killed&rdquo;</h2>

<p>Always insightful points from Benedict Evans:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This partly reflects the current political moment in the USA, but more fundamentally comes from ongoing concerns about the reliability of machine-learning-based systems in what can be life-or-death situations (especially with US cops&rsquo; tendency to shoot first). These systems look for patterns in data, and if you give them the wrong data they&rsquo;ll find the wrong pattern, so they&rsquo;re very easy to break if you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re doing. Hence, if you design a system badly and then train it only with criminals&rsquo; faces, and then give it a picture of whoever is in front of you, it will say &lsquo;well, this bank robber is the closest match&rsquo;.  Bad code can get people killed - hence the moratoria.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The NY Times has a story of someone arrested because face recognition wrongly matched him to a CCTV image of a shoplifter. There will be more stories like this: machine learning in general and face recognition in particular can only give probabilistic results, and ML systems trained on skewed data with skewed assumptions will produce skewed results. Part of what&rsquo;s interesting here is that the safeguards half-worked at each step: the software clearly said to treat the result with caution, the cops did a photo line-up rather than going straight to an arrest, and as soon as they got him in a room they realised they had the wrong man. But, they still arrested someone who doesn&rsquo;t look anything like the picture because &lsquo;the computer was wrong&rsquo;. This is partly an engineering problem, but mostly a training and process problem.</p>

<h2 id="when-the-sum-of-two-ux-improvements-becomes-a-huge-problem">When the Sum of Two UX Improvements Becomes a Huge Problem</h2>

<p>On their own, each &ldquo;solution&rdquo; makes sense.  Together, they lead to unintended consequences:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Turns out the combination of 1) Showing only one product if possible (and pointing it out very clearly, causing me to lower my guard), 2) Not showing out of stock items, and 3) The correct part for my car being out of stock causes 1) several days of extra waiting time, 2) extra work as I had to reassemble the car without fixing it and disassemble it again 5 days later to finally fix the problem, and 3) extra hassle as I have to return the parts I first ordered.</p>

<h2 id="the-blanding-all-sites-looking-the-same">The Blanding: All Sites Looking The Same</h2>

<p>The interesting part to me is not the &ldquo;blanding&rdquo; but the positive accessibility elements that result. Accessibility is a great exploration of error states that I want to write more about. Creative solutions are interesting, but come at a cognitive navigational cost that easily excludes people:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As for what can be made of this creeping conformity, on one hand, adhering to trends is totally normal in other realms of design, like fashion or architecture. And if designs are becoming more similar because they are using the same libraries, that means they are likely becoming more accessible to the visually impaired, since popular libraries are  <a href="https://darekkay.com/blog/accessible-ui-frameworks/">generally better at conforming to accessibility standards</a>  than individual developers. They are also more user-friendly, since new visitors will not have to spend as much time learning how to navigate the site’s pages. These are good things.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the internet is a shared cultural artifact, and its distributed, decentralized nature is what makes it unique. As home pages and fully customizable platforms like NeoPets and MySpace fade into memory, web design may lose much of its power as a form of creative expression. The Mozilla Foundation  <a href="https://internethealthreport.org/2018/">has argued</a>  that consolidation is bad for the “health” of the internet, and the aesthetics of the web could be seen as one element of its well-being.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.discovermagazine.com/technology/why-artificial-brains-need-sleep">https://www.discovermagazine.com/technology/why-artificial-brains-need-sleep</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The scientists ran computer simulations of a spiking neural network to find out what happened. They found that although it could learn to identify the data it was trained to look for, when such training went uninterrupted long enough, its neurons began to continuously fire no matter what signals they received.</p>

<p>Watkins recalled that &ldquo;almost in desperation,&rdquo; they tried having the simulation essentially undergo deep sleep. They exposed it to cycles of oscillating noise, roughly corresponding to the slow brain waves seen in deep sleep, which restored the simulation to stability. The researchers suggest this simulation of slow-wave sleep may help &ldquo;prevent neurons from hallucinating the features they&rsquo;re looking for in random noise,&rdquo; Watkins said.</p>

<p>These findings may help explain why all known biological neural systems capable of learning from their environment, from fruit flies to humans, undergo slow-wave sleep. Everyone needs slow-wave sleep, Kenyon said. &ldquo;Even aquatic mammals &ndash; whales, dolphins and so on &ndash; require periods of slow-wave sleep, despite the obvious evolutionary pressure to find some alternative. Instead, dolphins and whales sleep with half their brain at a time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of thoughts percolating aroung this. The most interesting to me is that these sorts of things are common &ndash; and totally fine! &ndash; in software, especially enterprise software that caters to developers. It&rsquo;s pretty common in terms of agile software development as well.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s <em>not</em> as common in user-facing software and even less so in public transport infrastructure, which is why it caught my attention (&ldquo;no data&rdquo; being an error state, in and of itself). It&rsquo;s a strange sort of scenario for transport maps to be replaced by screens that tell you that no data is forthcoming and that you should wait for the next refresh in 30 seconds.</p>

<p>I spotted this on a weekday evening and not during some strange witching hour. Trains were running every 5 minutes or so.</p>

<p>Anyway. Paper maps seem to be going away, even though they were perfectly adequate for almost a century. They&rsquo;re being replaced by &ldquo;advertising-adjacent hardware&rdquo; (go ahead and steal that). More on that too, having watched the subway&rsquo;s &lsquo;technology&rsquo; shift through at least three or four different types of digital displays, each one starting off showing useful information and ending up serving ads.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t fault the MTA for this though! Yes, replacing antiquated switches and command/control centers <em>is</em> important, but it is also largely invisible and doesn&rsquo;t bring in operating revenue. But adding screens that can show more advertising, at larger volume, and is easier to justify with metrics <em>is</em> what makes at least a portion of the money come in. These screens are also highly visibile improvements that someone can point to as &ldquo;look at us making upgrades!&rdquo; Because &ndash; with no sarcasm intended &ndash; it <em>is</em> nice to see real-time train data at the station (when it works, that is). I also can&rsquo;t fault Andy Byford* for bringing agile software development into infrastracture. It does sometimes break, but it also is quicker to deliver value and tends to have less fingerpointing because fixes can be deployed quicker too.</p>

<p><em>Note: This was written and photographed before Andy Byford departed the MTA. A loss for New York :/</em></p>

<p>I actually came across this back in March and it&rsquo;s a nice bookend to my post on <a href="https://errorstates.com/posts/005-linknyc-distributed-digital-hardware-at-scale/">LinkNYC</a> in general. Key quotes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Only about 1,800 of more than 4,500 kiosks that were promised by mid-2019 have been installed, Politico reports, with the majority of the kiosks located in Manhattan. Installation has been an expensive, bumpy process that’s fallen short of expectations. Local internet access on the kiosks was revoked in 2016 after officials discovered people were using them to watch pornography in public. Privacy advocates expressed concerns about the way the kiosks could be used to collect data on users. And in 2018, the city agreed to give CityBridge more time to build out the network and share the collected ad revenue.</p>

<p>The consortium behind the LinkNYC program, originally intended to create a free Wi-Fi network across the five boroughs of New York City, owes the city tens of millions of dollars and stopped installing its kiosks in 2018, Politico reports.</p>

    <p><p><img src="/images/007-ga-error2.jpg" alt="&quot;Google Analytics isn't working.&quot;" /></p>

<p>Well now.</p>

<p>Is it fair to call the COVID-19-initiated crisis the biggest error state of our world economy and healthcare system? Too soon?</p>

<p>Ok. I&rsquo;ll write about other things, such as the internet. With many more people suddenly working from home, or simply being home without an opportunity to leave, the internet-as-infrastructure grew severely strained at the end of March.</p>

<p>In a couple of memorable instances, it broke.</p>

<p>The title image is me trying to access Google Analytics as part of my day job. Earlier, even their error messages were giving me error message:</p>

<p><img src="/images/007-ga-error.jpg" alt="&quot;The error message's error message.&quot;" /></p>

<p>You know the error message is having an error message when it doesn&rsquo;t align with Material Design standards.</p>

<p>One can write an interesting history of the internet through the lens of error messages. For example, Twitter&rsquo;s infamous fail-whale was the perfect metaphor for rapidly growing internet companies in the aughts, when their infrastructure couldn&rsquo;t keep up with how quickly people were joining and using the platform:</p>

<p><img src="/images/007-twitter-fail-whale.jpg" alt="&quot;The fail whale&quot;" /></p>

<p>Or going a little deeper, do you know what all of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes">HTTP status codes</a> stand for?</p>
<pre><code>1xx informational response – the request was received, continuing process
2xx successful – the request was successfully received, understood, and accepted
3xx redirection – further action needs to be taken in order to complete the request
4xx client error – the request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled
5xx server error – the server failed to fulfil an apparently valid request</code></pre>
<p>The <code>200</code>, <code>301</code>, <code>404</code>, and <code>500</code> status codes are the ones most people are familiar with (the 200 means your request was fulfilled - if you load in a site, you&rsquo;re logging a <code>200</code> status).</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s go deeper still, into the wires themselves. Do you remember the memorable instance when a 75 year old lady in the Republic of Georgia was digging for copper and <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-12985082">accidentally cut the fiber optic cables that connected neighboring Armenia from the internet</a>?</p>

<p>Yes, the internet is really <a href="https://www.submarinecablemap.com">just a bunch of wires connecting data centers</a>:</p>

<p><img src="/images/007-internet-of-wires.jpg" alt="&quot;The internet of wires&quot;" /></p>

<hr />

<p>Sometimes it is easy to remember this.</p>

<p>Michael Lewis wrote a fascinating exploration of internet wires and latency while ostensibly talking about high-frequency trading in &ldquo;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Flash-Boys-Wall-Street-Revolt/dp/0393351599">Flash Boys</a>&rdquo;. When your arbitrage depends on acting on information received seconds or milliseconds faster than others, the length and bandwidth of those internet wires matters a great deal. (The climax of the expose was with a stock exchange that bucked the trend by making everyone equally <em>slow</em> to straighten the odds).</p>

<p>Or take bitcoin mining, when a lot of people went out and purchased industrial-sized quantities of processors, hooked them together and connected them to the internet. It wasn&rsquo;t that different from the late 90s and early naughts when running your website from a home-computer-as-a-server was still possible, and when most companies still had their own server farms. The biggest difference was that - in Iceland, at least - bitcoin mining ended up costing <a href="https://fortune.com/2018/02/13/iceland-bitcoin-mining-electricity/">more in energy than powering all the homes in the country</a>. As an interesting bit of trivia, bitcoin mining today seems to be done efficiently only by <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/a-new-york-power-plant-is-mining-50k-worth-of-bitcoin-a-day">literal power plants</a>.</p>

<p>If you work in the web technology space, you probably rely on CDNs (Content Delivery Networks). Using a CDN means distributing your content to multiple locations so that it can be served to you from the closest one. If you&rsquo;re in the middle of Turkey, you&rsquo;ll get your content from the Istanbul CDN location; if you&rsquo;re in New York, from the New York one. It keeps things working fast and creates safety-through-redundancy.</p>

<p><img src="/images/007-cloudflare.jpg" alt="&quot;Cloudflare CDN locations, as of April 2020&quot;" /></p>

<p>Sometimes, it is harder to remember.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve grown up after the 90s, or if you&rsquo;re not too tech savvy, it can be easy to forget about pipes and wires. It <em>just works</em>, right? The internet is in the air. It&rsquo;s present.</p>

<p>Even if you&rsquo;re tech savvy, virtualization is a major buzzword for forgetting the physicality of the internet. First you outsource your servers to someone else. Then you make those operating systems run virtually, in containers. The promise is of near-infinite scalability on demand. The reality is that scalability only extends as far as your provider has capacity for it scale to. Like Uber&rsquo;s &ldquo;Surge&rdquo; pricing (it goes up when everyone wants a ride), Amazon Web Services (AWS) manages this as a marketplace that automatically scales prices in response to demand.</p>

<p>Google (GCP) and Microsoft (Azure) do this too, but they&rsquo;re 2nd and 3rd and are still trying to make it work. They have less users than AWS, and consequentially less capacity. So when <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-cloud-services-demand-up-775-percent-prioritization-rules-in-place-due-to-covid-19/">Azure&rsquo;s demand went up more than 775%</a> on March 28th due to COVID-19-related changes, the company implemented prioritization rules and began to throttle customers&rsquo;s core functions:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re implementing a few temporary restrictions designed to balance the best possible experience for all of our customers. We have placed limits on free offers to prioritize capacity for existing customers. We also have limits on certain resources for new subscriptions. These are &lsquo;soft&rsquo; quota limits, and customers can raise support requests to increase these limits. If requests cannot be met immediately, we recommend customers use alternative regions (of our 54 live regions) that may have less demand surge. To manage surges in demand, we will expedite the creation of new capacity in the appropriate region.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Everything from email to chat to spinning up virtual servers was impacted, with cascading effects down the chain. Turns out the &ldquo;Cloud&rdquo; has very real physical limits.</p>

<hr />

<p>In the same vein, there&rsquo;s been a lot of talk about upgrading from 4G to 5G cellular technology. We&rsquo;re in 4G as I write this, and 4G has bandwidth limits that we&rsquo;re starting to run up against. The big stories in this space in 2018 and 2019 were about the big players &ndash; Netflix, Spotify, Youtube &ndash; cutting deals with telecom companies that allowed their content to be streamed for free, while competing services were still pay-to-play. This is important because for most of the world that still pays for data, the cost of streaming a song or a movie is high. That&rsquo;s both cost-as-in-price and cost-as-in-4G-bandwidth. They&rsquo;re connected, you see.</p>

<p>Fast forward to COVID-19. People are home. Some are working, some are unfortunately not. You can&rsquo;t go to the movies, you can&rsquo;t go out with friends. What do you do? You FaceTime friends and family, you set up Zoom happy hours, you catch up on shows from your favorite streaming service. You video, video, video, one of the most expensive (bandwidth-wise) pieces of content that you can consume. And mostly, you can do this because you don&rsquo;t pay for the bandwidth.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s an obvious strain on the internet. That&rsquo;s why Netflix, Youtube, Amazon Prime Video, and Apple TV are <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/netflix-amazon-prime-video-apple-youtube-asked-to-slow-down-streaming-so-internet-doesnt-overload/">all cutting down bitrates</a> (quality) in their streams, to alleviate some of bandwidth stress. But it&rsquo;s not just goodwill&hellip; the European Commissioner of Internal Markets <a href="https://twitter.com/ThierryBreton/status/1240353171748331523?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1240353171748331523&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnet.com%2Fnews%2Fnetflix-amazon-prime-video-apple-youtube-asked-to-slow-down-streaming-so-internet-doesnt-overload%2F">is <em>asking</em></a> for it:</p>

<p><img src="/images/007-eu-netflix.jpg" alt="&quot;Thierry Breton on Twitter, asking Netflix to cut back quality.&quot;" /></p>

<p>Which brings us back to the Google error I started my day with, a week ago. The one where the error message read in its entirety:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>500. That&rsquo;s an Error.</strong></p>

<p>There was an error. Please try again later. That&rsquo;s all we know.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Turns out, Google Cloud was having some of its own growing pains <a href="https://www.crn.com/news/cloud/google-cloud-outage-attributed-to-infrastructure-components-issues">related to infrastructure</a>: “We believe the issue with Google Cloud infrastructure components is partially resolved, and recovery is beginning. We do not have an ETA for full resolution at this point.”</p>

<p>If 2018 was all about the Internet of Things, and 2019 about the Internet of Privacy Violation, then I kind of expect 2020 to be about the Internet of Pipes, Capacity, and Physicality.</p>

<p>Well, probably not, but it sounds nice.</p>

<p>Not quite broken. A cola machine sits around, waiting to be maintained. Spotted at a movie theater. Someone must have opened it, started to work, and then - inevitable distracted - forgot about it without finishing the work. It was there when the movie started, it was there when the movie ended. The staff walk by, either not caring or not knowing what to do.</p>

<p>Sometimes, the error is in forgetting to start things back up correctly. Passerbys get to see the digital plumbing.</p>

<p>When I see things like this, I am drawn like a moth to a flame. I&rsquo;m interested in the technology used by <code>Crew</code>. I&rsquo;m curious about <code>Manual Override</code>. Having back-of-house technology exposed like this is a very particular kind of error state.</p>

<h2 id="tesla-tricked-into-speeding-by-researchers-using-electrical-tape">Tesla tricked into speeding by researchers using electrical tape</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tesla-tricked-into-speeding-by-researchers-using-electrical-tape/">https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tesla-tricked-into-speeding-by-researchers-using-electrical-tape/</a></p>

<p>Eisenhower and his ambitious interstate highway system transformed the US into a nation with infrastructure primarily designed around cars and large machinery. As we  roll out more autonomous vehicles and implement machine vision more broadly in public spaces, we&rsquo;re going to again redefine who public spaces are designed for. There&rsquo;s a lot in here, but I don&rsquo;t have enough to write a full exploration yet.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>McAfee technicians fooled the car into reading the speed limit as 85 miles per hour by placing black tape across the middle of the first digit on a 35 mile per hour sign. That caused the vehicle&rsquo;s cruise control system to automatically accelerate, according to McAfee. The tests involved a 2016 Model S and Model X that used technology made by Mobileye, a division of Intel. Tesla stopped using the company&rsquo;s camera systems in 2016. The newest Tesla models do not use Mobileye technology &ldquo;and do not currently appear to support traffic sign recognition at all,&rdquo; McAfee researchers Steve Povolny and Shivangee Trivedi wrote in a blog post.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Traffic sign fonts are determined by regulators, and so advanced driver-assistance systems are primarily focused on other more challenging use cases, and this system in particular was designed to support human drivers — not autonomous driving,&rdquo; a Mobileye spokesperson said by email. &ldquo;Autonomous vehicle technology will not rely on sensing alone, but will also be supported by various other technologies and data, such as crowdsourced mapping, to ensure the reliability of the information received from the camera sensor and offer more robust redundancies and safety.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.roboflow.ai/self-driving-car-dataset-missing-pedestrians/">https://blog.roboflow.ai/self-driving-car-dataset-missing-pedestrians/</a>; Related discussion: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22298882">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22298882</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>We were surprised and concerned when we discovered that a popular dataset (5,100 stars and 1,800 forks) being used by thousands of students to build an open-source self driving car contains critical errors and omissions.
We did a hand-check of the 15,000 images in the widely used Udacity Dataset 2 and found problems with 4,986 (33%) of them. Amongst these were thousands of unlabeled vehicles, hundreds of unlabeled pedestrians, and dozens of unlabeled cyclists. We also found many instances of phantom annotations, duplicated bounding boxes, and drastically oversized bounding boxes.
Perhaps most egregiously, 217 (1.4%) of the images were completely unlabeled but actually contained cars, trucks, street lights, and/or pedestrians.</p>

<p>Some notes from The Prepared. Always insightsful takes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Making &amp; Manufacturing.</strong>
    <a href="https://theprepared.us3.list-manage.com/track/click?u=2e2c86e49a5f6d1fd1ab7ce70&amp;id=0b917a48f4&amp;e=d8caa171eb">Adam Savage made a rickshaw for his Boston Dynamics Spot</a> , and had Spot tow him around while wearing a top hat. Aside from the obvious observation (that this is a silly project), the bloopers at the end of the video provide a little taste for BD&rsquo;s  <a href="https://theprepared.us3.list-manage.com/track/click?u=2e2c86e49a5f6d1fd1ab7ce70&amp;id=69ccb56a6a&amp;e=d8caa171eb">technology readiness level</a> ; Spot doesn&rsquo;t seem to really &ldquo;just work.&rdquo; I also found myself ruminating on how workshops like Savage&rsquo;s are wondrous, enchanting places - and how <em>fabrication</em> (the act of converting materials into parts and assemblies) looks almost nothing like <em>manufacturing</em> (the act of making a thing, over and over again, in a repeatable and predictable way). I love both of those things, and each of them is visually fascinating, but I try to be cognizant of the spectrum between them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Maintenance, Repair &amp; Operations.</strong>
    This is slightly old news by now, but <a href="https://theprepared.us3.list-manage.com/track/click?u=2e2c86e49a5f6d1fd1ab7ce70&amp;id=2d7c7f1de9&amp;e=d8caa171eb">owners of older Haas machining centers are revolting</a>  over lack of product support on older tools (like, 90s and aughts). I have some sympathy for Haas here, but I&rsquo;m also aware that manufacturers of heavy equipment like Caterpillar and John Deere (note,  <a href="https://theprepared.us3.list-manage.com/track/click?u=2e2c86e49a5f6d1fd1ab7ce70&amp;id=96935c7d69&amp;e=d8caa171eb">Deere has other <em>big</em> issues on maintainability</a> ) keep huge libraries of old casting &amp; forging tools so that they can support ancient equipment. Presumably we&rsquo;ll eventually get to a steady state where control boards are seen the same way mechanical parts are; I wonder whether the end of Moore&rsquo;s law, over which there has been so much hand-wringing, might at least bring some stability to the electronics market and give a little more heft to the argument that electronics are only end-of-life because nobody&rsquo;s willing to pay for them to be resuscitated.</p>

<h2 id="cloudflare-silently-deleted-my-dns-records">Cloudflare silently deleted my DNS records</h2>

<p><a href="https://txti.es/cloudflare-deleted-my-dns">https://txti.es/cloudflare-deleted-my-dns</a></p>

<p>Interesting from the perspective of error-handling and cloud-services as fundamental communications infrastructure:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If I intentionally set out to build a horrible user experience I&rsquo;m unsure if I could top this. I naively expected that I would be notified by email before Cloudflare broke everything. In the absence of that, I would expect to see a notice when I logged in. In the absence of that, I would expect to see a field in the audit log mentioning in human language what happened. In the absence of that, if for some arcane reason Cloudflare is unable to change the format of their audit logs, I would at a minimum expect a message on the audit log page that explained what a deletion logged to 127.0.0.1 means. I registered for Cloudflare with a Gmail address specifically so that I could receive notifications from them if there were issues with my email setup.</p>

<p>To add insult to injury I learn that when Cloudflare automatically detects an anomaly with your domain they permanently delete all DNS records. Mine won&rsquo;t be difficult to restore, but I&rsquo;m not sure why this is necessary. Surely it would be possible for Cloudflare to mark a domain as disabled without irrevocably deleting it? Combined with the hacky audit log, I&rsquo;m left with the opinion that for some reason Cloudflare decided to completely half-ass the part of their system that is responsible for deleting everything that matters to a user. Because Cloudflare deleted my domain registration I can&rsquo;t change the status from clientTransferProhibited through their dashboard so I don&rsquo;t think I can even leave.</p>

<p>This one is back from 2009 and not entirelty a bug, but still relevant and came in up conversation recently (I&rsquo;m working with a team to implement an ERP at my day job):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Shane Co. signed a contract with SAP AG in 2005 for a &ldquo;highly sophisticated point-of-sale and inventory management system,&rdquo; with an original projected cost of $8 million to $10 million and a one-year rollout schedule, the filing states. But costs ended up skyrocketing to $36 million, and the implementation stretched out to 32 months before the ERP system eventually went live in September 2007.</p>

<p>The company noted that it subsequently discovered that the new system &ldquo;did not yet provide accurate inventory count numbers,&rdquo; causing Shane to become &ldquo;substantially overstocked with inventory, and with the wrong mix of inventory.&rdquo; That added to Shane&rsquo;s capital costs and affected sales for the rest of 2007 and the first nine months of 2008, the court document says.</p>
