I spent most of November road tripping across the country, so this roundup included both October and November materials.

## Data Bias

This:

> Taxis in my country are generally black. I’ve watched enough movies to know that all of the ones in America are yellow. But in every other country I’ve visited, taxis have been a mish-mash of different hues.

> This annoys me. Will Google’s self driving cars simply not recognise London’s Black Cabs? Will any yellow car in the UK be classified as a taxi by the infallible algorithm? Will Google refuse to believe I’m human simply because I don’t know what a Twinkie is?

> Before sticking a comment below, riddle me this – if something costs a half-a-crown, and you pay with a florin, how many tanners will you get in your change?

## Healthcare

Code rot and data bias in health devices: https://apple.news/A8IvTES9NRPWijHhtnUG89Q

> Vaughan was spurred into action when the continuous glucose monitor (CGM) function on a mobile app used by his daughter, who has had Type-1 Diabetes her entire life, failed. "Features were disappearing, critical alerts weren't working, and notifications just stopped," he stated. As a result, his nine-year-old daughter, who relied on the CGM alerts, had to rely on their own instincts.
> The apps, which Vaughan had downloaded in 2016, were "completely useless" by the end of 2018. "The Vaughans felt alone, but suspected they weren't. They took to the reviews on Google Play and Apple App store and discovered hundreds of patients and caregivers complaining about similar issues."
> Code rot isn't the only issue lurking in medical device software. A recent study out of Stanford University finds the training data used for the AI algorithms in medical devices are only based on a small sample of patients. Most algorithms, 71 percent, are trained on datasets from patients in only three geographic areas -- California, Massachusetts and New York -- "and that the majority of states have no represented patients whatsoever." While the Stanford research didn't expose bad outcomes from AI trained on the geographies, but raised questions about the validity of the algorithms for patients in other areas.

## Cars and Electronics

Land Rover’s New $83,000 Defender Is an Alpha Male Still in Beta: https://apple.news/ALQvXPSQ8Qd6Is1ROxLXP8Q

> The bigger concern is the electronics. New owners have complained about minor, but annoying, glitches: a clock that works only intermittently, keyless entry failure, irregularities with the preprogrammed infotainment system, poor operation of the side-hinged rear door, even an engine stall at a stoplight when the stop-start function failed.

> Although I didn’t note any issues with the electronics or technology on my desert run, the reports I’ve heard of computer errors must temper my endorsement. When I asked the company about these problems afterward, it responded that corrective software updates are “the new normal” in the auto business. So, caveat emptor: After a top-to-bottom rethink, the alpha male of off-roading is still in beta.

> Dude comes straight from the dealership for a car-seat installation, but halfway through the car disables itself (I'm guessing some anti-tamper safeguard). Hilariously, the boys at Ferrari can't remotely fix it because there's no reception underground
