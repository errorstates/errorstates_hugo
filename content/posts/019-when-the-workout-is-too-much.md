# 019 - Too Much of a Workout

!["Les Mills Has Stopped, 1"](/images/019/019-les-mills-1.jpg)

Judging by the buttons, it looks like it is running a flavor of `Android`.

Another bike:

I can't blame Les Mills. Cardio is hard. 

I've never actually pressed the `ok` button. Do you want to close it? I see it at my local gym pretty routinely. I wonder what will happen? Will it shut the machine down?

Another thought: sometimes, trying to make a machine "smart" makes it dumb. There's a perfectly fine analog exercise bike next to it. It won't entertain you while you're working out, but maybe you don't need to be exercised while you work out. (Pelaton would argue with me here). But as Blaise Pascal wrote: “All of humanity's problems stem from man's inability to sit quietly in a room alone.” 

I wonder what Blaise Pascal would say about entertainment/exercise bikes.
