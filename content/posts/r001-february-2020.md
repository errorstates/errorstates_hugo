# Roundup, February 2020

## Tesla tricked into speeding by researchers using electrical tape
[https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tesla-tricked-into-speeding-by-researchers-using-electrical-tape/](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tesla-tricked-into-speeding-by-researchers-using-electrical-tape/)

Eisenhower and his ambitious interstate highway system transformed the US into a nation with infrastructure primarily designed around cars and large machinery. As we  roll out more autonomous vehicles and implement machine vision more broadly in public spaces, we're going to again redefine who public spaces are designed for. There's a lot in here, but I don't have enough to write a full exploration yet. 

> McAfee technicians fooled the car into reading the speed limit as 85 miles per hour by placing black tape across the middle of the first digit on a 35 mile per hour sign. That caused the vehicle's cruise control system to automatically accelerate, according to McAfee. The tests involved a 2016 Model S and Model X that used technology made by Mobileye, a division of Intel. Tesla stopped using the company's camera systems in 2016. The newest Tesla models do not use Mobileye technology "and do not currently appear to support traffic sign recognition at all," McAfee researchers Steve Povolny and Shivangee Trivedi wrote in a blog post.

>"Traffic sign fonts are determined by regulators, and so advanced driver-assistance systems are primarily focused on other more challenging use cases, and this system in particular was designed to support human drivers â€” not autonomous driving," a Mobileye spokesperson said by email. "Autonomous vehicle technology will not rely on sensing alone, but will also be supported by various other technologies and data, such as crowdsourced mapping, to ensure the reliability of the information received from the camera sensor and offer more robust redundancies and safety."

>We were surprised and concerned when we discovered that a popular dataset (5,100 stars and 1,800 forks) being used by thousands of students to build an open-source self driving car contains critical errors and omissions.
We did a hand-check of the 15,000 images in the widely used Udacity Dataset 2 and found problems with 4,986 (33%) of them. Amongst these were thousands of unlabeled vehicles, hundreds of unlabeled pedestrians, and dozens of unlabeled cyclists. We also found many instances of phantom annotations, duplicated bounding boxes, and drastically oversized bounding boxes.
Perhaps most egregiously, 217 (1.4%) of the images were completely unlabeled but actually contained cars, trucks, street lights, and/or pedestrians.

> **Making & Manufacturing.**
	[Adam Savage made a rickshaw for his Boston Dynamics Spot](https://theprepared.us3.list-manage.com/track/click?u=2e2c86e49a5f6d1fd1ab7ce70&id=0b917a48f4&e=d8caa171eb) , and had Spot tow him around while wearing a top hat. Aside from the obvious observation (that this is a silly project), the bloopers at the end of the video provide a little taste for BD's  [technology readiness level](https://theprepared.us3.list-manage.com/track/click?u=2e2c86e49a5f6d1fd1ab7ce70&id=69ccb56a6a&e=d8caa171eb) ; Spot doesn't seem to really "just work." I also found myself ruminating on how workshops like Savage's are wondrous, enchanting places - and how *fabrication* (the act of converting materials into parts and assemblies) looks almost nothing like *manufacturing* (the act of making a thing, over and over again, in a repeatable and predictable way). I love both of those things, and each of them is visually fascinating, but I try to be cognizant of the spectrum between them.

Also:

> **Maintenance, Repair & Operations.**
	This is slightly old news by now, but [owners of older Haas machining centers are revolting](https://theprepared.us3.list-manage.com/track/click?u=2e2c86e49a5f6d1fd1ab7ce70&id=2d7c7f1de9&e=d8caa171eb)  over lack of product support on older tools (like, 90s and aughts). I have some sympathy for Haas here, but I'm also aware that manufacturers of heavy equipment like Caterpillar and John Deere (note,  [Deere has other *big* issues on maintainability](https://theprepared.us3.list-manage.com/track/click?u=2e2c86e49a5f6d1fd1ab7ce70&id=96935c7d69&e=d8caa171eb) ) keep huge libraries of old casting & forging tools so that they can support ancient equipment. Presumably we'll eventually get to a steady state where control boards are seen the same way mechanical parts are; I wonder whether the end of Moore's law, over which there has been so much hand-wringing, might at least bring some stability to the electronics market and give a little more heft to the argument that electronics are only end-of-life because nobody's willing to pay for them to be resuscitated.
